# Project: Real-ESRGAN Image Upscaler

## Workflow Instructions

- **Save plans**: When working from a plan, always save it to the `plans/` folder (e.g., `plans/my-feature.md`) before starting execution. Mark steps as done in the plan file as you complete them.
- **Follow the plan**: When executing a plan, follow it step by step. After completing each step, mark it as done in the plan file.
- **Write docs**: Write documentation to the `docs/` folder in the project as you go.
- **Test after every step**: Run relevant tests after completing each step to verify correctness before moving on.
- **Commit after every step**: Make a git commit after each step is completed.
- **Staging files**: Prefer `git add .` when staging files for commits.
- **Virtual environment**: Use `uv` for venv setup and dependency installation (not pip/venv).
