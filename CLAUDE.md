# Project: Real-ESRGAN Image Upscaler

## Implementation Plan

Follow the plan in `implementation_plan.md`. The active working plan is also tracked at `~/.claude/plans/optimized-petting-lovelace.md`.

## Workflow Instructions

- **Update the plan**: After completing each step, mark it as done in `implementation_plan.md`.
- **Write docs**: Write documentation to the `docs/` folder in the project as you go.
- **Commit after every step**: Make a git commit after each implementation step is completed.
- **Virtual environment**: Use `uv` for venv setup and dependency installation (not pip/venv).
